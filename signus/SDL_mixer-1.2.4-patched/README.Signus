This is a patched version of SDL_mixer for use in Signus. This is temporary solution,
this directory will go away when SDL_mixer 1.2.5 is released.

Modifications that were made are:
  - added ability to load Ogg Vorbis files as samples
  - removed all MIDI code because Signus doesn't use it
  - removed various huge project files that Signus doesn't need (yet?)
