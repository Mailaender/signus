#> Helios is a combat hovercraft armed with Beta 3 medium gun and a heavy
 anti-aircraft machine gun of similar design as that used by Perseus Gamma
 tanks.
#> This unit is in essence an analogue of the Perseus Beta medium tank. The
 main advantage of Helios is its mobility which allows it to be deployed even
 in terrain where normal tanks could move only with great difficulty. Another
 great asset of this hovercraft is its anti-aircraft gun which allows it to
 serve in the air defense role.
#> Shortly after its creation, this war machine was added to the emblem of
 Zimbowanese legions (elite Eutanian units) which constitute 1/3 of all
 soldiers in the Signus forces.
