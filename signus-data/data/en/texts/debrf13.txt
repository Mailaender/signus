#> We boarded transport ships and launched the attack on Ternulon island
 as ordered. Despite some casualties, we have managed to take control over
 Ternulon and the islands around it. The enemy tried to use the artefact
 against us but except for a few, our soldiers followed the instructions. Fort
 Satran has been captured and the artefact is now aboard a plane heading to
 Tankred.
#> We are forced to stay on the islands for the time being - the inexplicable
 earthquakes#001 have stirred up the sea so much that weighing the anchor now
 is far too risky...
