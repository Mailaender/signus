#> Mission accomplished.
#> Shortly after Signus units broke into the Consortium base, all compounds
 were captured and the Betas secured. However, a captured signaler was allowed
 to escape due to negligence and he most likely sent a distress signal to the
 Consortium HQ. We have not detected any response from the enemy yet. The army
 should arrive within 180 minutes to keep the Consortium out of the area.
