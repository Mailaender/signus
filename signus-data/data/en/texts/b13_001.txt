#> The strange phenomena that occur almost daily on all the continents of
 Arkonis have provoked various reactions around the world. What is happening?
 What is the meaning of the seemingly harmless mists rising out of the earth,
 the frequent earthquakes, the giant sea waves that can crush even large
 tankers like paper boats?
#> Scientists have locked themselves in their offices, the corporations keep
 silence...
#> Frightened citizens are desperate for any explanation. Older people bring
 up old legends almost lost to time, myths that before humans came, Arkonis
 was home to ancient gods. However, the gods were too proud to agree with
 humans on sharing the land, which led to a long and devastating war after
 which the gods had to flee. They hid themselves in unreachable depths of
 Arkonis and went into age-long sleep. Is the heaving earth and the mists the
 breath of awakening gods who are now rising again to take revenge?
#> People talk about the end of the world. But one especially popular theory
 says that the earthquakes are generated by the defeated ancient Arkonian
 civilization which went into hiding after the conflict with humans, learned
 to understand human behavior after their failed attempts to establish contact
 with us so long ago and now they're trying to get our attention.
#> But so far, nobody knows why...
