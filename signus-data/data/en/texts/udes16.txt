#> Medea is an engineering vehicle. This unit has no armament and only light
 armor. Its automated systems are controlled remotely from friendly bases.
#> The main purpose of these remotely controlled vehicles is building and
 repairing bridges and railroad tracks. One of the important design goals for
 these units was to save space and production resources. For that reason,
 Medea is a fully automated factory on wheels controlled from the base
 similarly to Gnome. Its main weakness is weak armor and low durability which
 makes it vulnerable to artillery fire.

 of Signus forces.
