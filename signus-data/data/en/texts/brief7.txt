#> 
#> The primary objective of this mission is to neutralize the enemy Setrix
 base southwest of here.
#> We plan to make use of the existing railroad connection between the bases
 in this mission.
#> The railroad passes through Lebaran territory and it is in perfect
 condition so there should be no issues with damaged tracks. Our workers are
 currently assembling the trains in our factory, specifically a new model of
 the Mohican war train.
#> According to latest reports, Consortium forces are advancing rapidly so
 neutralizing Setrix presents an opportunity to block enemy incursion deeper
 into Toricon territory.
#> At least for a while...
