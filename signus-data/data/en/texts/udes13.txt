#> Xenon is a mine layer. It is equipped with mine deployment system and a
 metal detector connected to fully automated bulldozer blade at the front. It
 has weak armor and no armament.
#> The need for designing this unit came from defensive missions where the
 numerical superiority of Consortium forces precluded deployment of our tank
 squadrons because the losses would be too high. Increasing deployment of
 mine layers then also necessitated a unit capable of disarming enemy mines.
 Thus the Xenon, which was originally intended for defensive operations only,
 is frequently deployed in the front lines of assault missions as well.
#> HQ reports: "Xenon is one of the units which should be unavailable to
 Consortium forces. However, there is a strong suspicion that its blueprints
 were stolen by Consortium spies."
