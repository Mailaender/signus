#> The PEGASUS Artefact
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> Yesterday we have finally managed to determine the special qualities of the
 artefact found a few miles from Sanukor. Many times in the past we had
 strange feelings of lightness in the vicinity of Pegasus but only now we are
 able to use this strange phenomenon to a greater extent.
#> Professor R. Generson has performed several ballistic experiments with
 projectiles fired under the influence of Pegasus. Our hypothesis was
 confirmed by calculating the trajectory deviation from a straight line. Zero
 deviation, which means that Pegasus has unquestionably some effect on gravity
 and thus also the projectile trajectory.
#> Tests with larger caliber weapons have produced the same results.
#> The Consortium leadership is pushing for military applications of Pegasus
 such as artillery bombardment of Toricon bases over extreme distances.
#> However, we haven't made much progress in this direction yet. Research
 continues under prof. Generson's supervision.
