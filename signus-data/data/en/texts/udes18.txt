#> The Gnome munitions transporter is a mobile computer-controlled chemical
 laboratory capable of producing ammo within a few minutes and supplying it to
 another unit.
#> The need for designing a munitions transporter capable of supplying ammo to
 front line units arose when rocket launcher vehicles joined the ranks of
 Signus forces. Similarly to the closely related Ceres fuel transporters, the
 armor of Gnomes was neglected for the sake of mobility and to speed up
 development. These units can safely operate only in the rear lines under
 protection by friendly forces.
#> When a Gnome gets destroyed, the explosion will cause serious damage to all
 units in vicinity.
#> HQ reports: "These are the most expensive ground units in the regular army.
 Signus commandos have priority on their use."
