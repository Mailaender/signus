#> Minotaur is a defense turret armed with long-range artillery gun firing
 explosive ammunition. Its armor is similar in composition to that of Perseus
 Beta medium tanks.
#> This turret is used primarily to protect important bases and research
 facilities. It has remarkably long detection and firing range which makes it
 one of the most dreaded defensive structures. Minotaur's greatest weakness is
 its weak armor (for a turret). Its main advantage, on the other hand, is its
 explosive ammunition which allows it to hit multiple targets with one shot.
#> During military exercises, there were cases where a single Minotaur crushed
 the opponent's entire army. But there were also cases where one helicopter
 crushed an entire army of Minotaurs.
