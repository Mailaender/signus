 #p.toricon.282.183. 
#> Aircraft carrier Imperi, 15 miles off the coast of Lebrukon
#> Toricon has received warning that the Consortium is mobilizing forces in
 the area of eastern Lebrukon in order to occupy the forbidden Zones in
 Lebaran. Our bases Kytan and Setrix report that the enemy has not tried to
 breach our defenses yet but it could happen soon. For security reasons,
 Toricon has decided to eliminate all Consortium bases located in those areas.
 Due to the expected destructive impact of a major invasion, we should
 verify the accuracy of the warning. However, Toricon cannot wait that long.
 Aircraft carriers are currently needed at the coast of Losabo where Toricon
 navy is trying to break the continental blockade that has already lasted
 several weeks.
#> Your mission is to first take control over a few airports in the coastal
 area so that we can move our bombers there. Then, after we verify the threat
 of enemy incursion into Toricon territory, launch the attack on enemy bases
 in eastern Lebrukon from the captured airports.
