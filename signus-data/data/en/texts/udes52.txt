#> Heliports are the equivalent of airports for aircrafts with the vertical
 take-off and landing capability. Thus they are intended to service the Rex
 attack helicopters and Mystic artefact-generation fighter-bombers. All
 heliports are equipped with a guidance system of a similar type to the one
 used by airports, a fully automated hangar and a security system known as
 "The Seal" which is used in all structures (perhaps with the exception of
 repair bays). They also have excellent built-in radars which, although not as
 good as airport radars, still provide vital tactical data especially to
 combat units. One of the weaknesses of this building is its somewhat weak
 outer armor which makes it vulnerable to prolonged artillery barrage.
