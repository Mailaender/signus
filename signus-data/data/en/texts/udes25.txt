#> Neptune is a transport hovercraft. It was developed using ancient Arkonian
 technology. It has no armament.
#> The main advantage of these vehicles is their ability to transport units
 across terrain where normal ground units could move only with great
 difficulty or with the help of Medea engineering vehicles. Neptune's biggest
 weakness is its low durability when under fire which precludes its deployment
 without protection by long-range weapons.
#> "These units should be transferred to the civilian sector after our victory
 in this conflict where they will replace transport ships. That should improve
 the public image of the army." - an excerpt from Defense Department's report
 to the Board of Directors.
