#> Viking is a destroyer. It is armed with Ghecker medium gun, light
 anti-aircraft gun and depth charges Aglovian.
#> Deployment of these units is recommended only in larger fleets with support
 from heavier battleships or cruisers. It has also proven necessary to deploy
 them as convoy escort ships to provide air defense for Lagoon aircraft
 carriers. Another major advantage of these ships is their radar system which
 allows them to detect enemy submarines and mines.
#> "Although Viking is rather weak on its own, it is a crucial support unit
 and sometimes even plays a decisive role in naval battles." - comment from
 vice admiral Gretzski.
