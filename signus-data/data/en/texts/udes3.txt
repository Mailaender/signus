#> Perseus Gamma is a battle tank designed for front-line combat. It is armed
 with twin heavy main gun and Grund anti-aircraft machine gun. It has heavy
 armor.
#> These units are deployed in combat mainly for their great destructive power
 and considerable toughness. Another major advantage of this unit is its
 anti-aircraft machine gun which together with other features allows it to
 operate behind enemy lines even without support. The only weakness of this
 behemoth is its limited mobility which makes it an easy target for enemy
 turrets and long-range weapons.
#> "The difference between getting blasted in a Gamma and in a Beta is that if
 they blast you in a Gamma, you'll die with the warm fuzzy feeling that they
 had to dump way more ammo into you." - writing on Perseus Gamma garages.
