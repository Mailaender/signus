#> Horizon is an anti-aircraft turret equipped with a single direct-fire flak
 gun with limited range. It has no weapons for defense against ground targets.
#> These turrets are deployed to protect important bases. Their task is to
 provide effective anti-air barrage together with Phalanges and prevent enemy
 air force form attacking. Horizon's main weakness is its low durability and
 insufficient armor against heavier weapons. Because it is the only turret of
 its kind in the Signus forces, it is recommended to protect it with
 long-range weapons against ground attack.
#> HQ reports: "These turrets have proven to be inadequate against helicopters
 during combat exercises, therefore we recommend using them in combination
 with Phalanges."
