#> Our next task is to test the newly developed weapon codenamed Goliath.
#> It is a howitzer with exceptional range and firepower developed using
 artefact technology research.
#> The Amenur#001 village#001 with 856 inhabitants was chosen as the test
 target. It is situated in the desert area of Rotenalia, specifically in the
 northern part of the territory.
#> Toricon also requires absolute secrecy in execution of this operation -
 i.e. eliminating potential witnesses etc. If the results of Goliath
 deployment reach the public, it will cause major problems for Toricon.
