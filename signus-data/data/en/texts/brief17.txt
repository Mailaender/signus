#> In the next few hours, you will take part in the most important operation
 of this global conflict and your entire life. Toricon is preparing for an
 offensive which could decide the final outcome of the war. After several
 failed attempts, Toricon has managed to defeat the Consortium in a naval
 battle and thus open a passage to Lystonian shores for its fleet. We are
 currently mobilizing all forces to deal the final blow to the enemy. But
 first, we need a beachhead in enemy territory where we could assemble our
 forces for the decisive battle. We expect you to take care of this little
 problem as soon as possible.
#> You will land on the northeast shore three hours after leaving the Luton
 seaport. The enemy is most likely expecting us by now so prepare for fierce
 resistance right from the beginning of the operation. Once you eliminate the
 coastal turrets, your next objective is to break through the defenses and
 advance further inland. There is a short strip of military bases a few miles
 away from the shore. You need to capture them as well because we plan to use
 them later.
