#> Now that we have successfully repelled the Consortium attack, enemy units
 are retreating from the area around Batix. They are returning to Tortugal as
 expected.
#> Toricon considers the presence of any bases outside Toricon control in the
 vicinity of Batix to be unacceptable. Top management therefore deems most
 appropriate to take advantage of the numerical superiority of our forces and
 attack Tortugal.
#> In addition, we have learned from one of our sources about artefacts which
 could give the Consortium power threatening Toricon's strongholds. Thus it is
 crucial to capture Tortugal and acquire all the artefacts together with
 documents about latest research.
