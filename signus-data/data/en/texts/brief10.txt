#> Trix base
#> We have just received a distress signal sent by the Toricon base Oberun.
#> It appears that Consortium strike forces launched a surprise attack
 yesterday and managed to seize control over the only access path to Oberun -
 the Torvill Pass. After taking control of the valley, they brought in
 additional forces. The distress signal was faint, we can expect that our base
 could fall at any moment...
#> Our oath makes it our duty to help a friendly base in danger, therefore I
 am issuing an order to attack Torvill.
#> We have to fight our way through the valley, draw part of enemy units away
 from the base and destroy the besieging army using our combined forces. But
 there's a catch: They will be expecting us. The valley provides a great
 defensive position.
#> Expect to come across land mines, defensive turrets?, etc...
