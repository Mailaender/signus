#> Welcome back to Tridi Vision war news.
#> Shortly after six o'clock today, the Consortim suffered major losses for
 the first time in a long while.
#> Toricon's strike force has launched an assault on important Consortium
 military seaport Sotorat in western part of Hedar. Our correspondents report
 that the Consortium had a giant secret factory producing all sorts of weapons
 right in the middle of Sotorat.
#> Aside from this factory, the Consortium also has other weapon supply lines
 such as business dealings with the Artefix corporation which provides
 aircrafts to them. However, this information is as yet unconfirmed. As for
 Toricon, we have not been able to uncover their supply lines yet except for
 the recently captured Sotorat.
