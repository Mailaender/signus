#> Perseus Beta is a newer and more powerful version of its smaller brother
 Alpha. It is equipped with U66 medium main gun and fairly strong armor.
#> Beta is used as a front-line battle tank due to its armor, shorter range
 and fairly high toughness (especially in missions where deployment of heavier
 units is not possible) but it can also be used very effectively for
 eliminating small pockets of resistance (artillery turrets, etc.) or
 protecting friendly buildings (depots, bases, radars).
#> Message for commanders: The rumors that our agents have stolen the
 blueprints for this tank from the Consortium are completely unfounded. Anyone
 spreading these rumors is considered a traitor and should be punished
 accordingly.
