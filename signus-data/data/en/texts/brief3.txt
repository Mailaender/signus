#> Centaur base
#> The presence of any enemy bases around Centaur poses a potential threat to
 us in the current situation. Toricon top management has therefore decided
 that it'll be safer to take over control of those bases.
#> The targets are Arten to the northeast from here and Sanukor to the west.
 According to our intelligence department, both bases are under control of
 Consortium forces so we must finish this operation quickly to avoid getting
 surprised by reinforcements from other bases in the area.
#> Arten is the first objective. It is connected to Sanukor by railroad which
 allows us to make use of the recently developed Olympus#001 transport train.
 We will assemble the train from parts available in the Arten factory and use
 it for faster transport of Signus units and ordnance.
#> It is crucial to capture Arten and attack Sanukor before they can detect
 our approach.
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Capture the Arten and Sanukor bases
