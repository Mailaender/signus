#> Mohican is a standard battle train. It is armed with AGON medium gun and
 38mm anti-aircraft machine gun. It has fairly strong armor with high
 durability.
#> The main advantage of this unit is its versatility. It is fast, tough, and
 able to attack both ground and air targets. It was designed as a front-line
 support unit more than equal to regular tanks. Its only weakness (which is
 common to all trains) is its mobility restricted by railroad tracks. The bane
 of these units are mine layers which can paralyze an entire army of Mohicans
 with just a few mines. Therefore we recommend using these units in
 combination with Xenons.
