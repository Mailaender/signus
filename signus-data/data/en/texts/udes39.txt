#> Cobra is a light bomber equipped with high-explosive bombs and a heavy
 machine gun for aerial combat. It has light armor.
#> The biggest advantage of these units is their high maneuverability which
 together with their speed allows them to quickly move to areas under threat.
 Their main disadvantage is low toughness which means that they can be used
 effectively only in larger formations or together with their larger siblings
 the Saturns. In air-to-air combat, they have to rely on protection by Icarus
 and Mystic fighters.
#> HQ reports: "The rumors that general Esencki has killed himself when he
 lost control over this plane during a test flight are completely unfounded
 and slandering this great man who should be a role model for all of us.
 Anyone caught spreading these rumors can be court-martialed."
