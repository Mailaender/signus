#> Proton is an aerial refueling plane. Just like all the other support units,
 Proton has no armament. It has no armor either. It is powered by twin jet
 engines of a similar type to the ones used by Saturn heavy bomber.
#> These aircrafts were not designed for deployment in direct combat. This
 is reflected in their low toughness which precludes flying Protons through
 areas controlled by enemy air defense. In aerial combat, they have to rely on
 fighter escorts similarly to Saturns and Caesars. Deployment of these units
 is planned only in larger aerial battles where the enemy may have significant
 numerical superiority.
#> Although Protons have been developed a long time ago and they are used by
 the regular army as well, they have entered service in the Signus forces only
 recently, in particular due to their vulnerability.
