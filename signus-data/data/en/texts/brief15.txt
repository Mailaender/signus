#> One of the last noteworthy areas which remain outside Toricon control is
 the Penytras island. An unusual fact about the island is that despite its
 temperate climate, there are no civilian inhabitants. The Consortium uses it
 as their main artefact research center, new weapons testing grounds and
 strike force training facility.
#> Acquiring Penytras would be a major gain for Toricon. The HQ is
 particularly interested in the laser tanks which are currently being tested
 there and would like to put them into service among our ground forces soon.
 Given that the Consortium is under heavy pressure in the area of southeast
 Eutania#001, we expect that most military units are currently deployed away
 from the island. The company has decided to use the opportunity and take over
 control of Penytras.

#> We have received a detailed map with the placement of defensive turrets and
 other important points from our operative inside the Consortium on the
 island. Study it carefully because having accurate intel will speed up our
 operation. You will be transported to the island by ships equipped with
 stealth plating so Penytras won't get a chance to call for reinforcements
 until we get detected by coastal radars.
#> The element of surprise should buy us enough time to complete the
 operation.
