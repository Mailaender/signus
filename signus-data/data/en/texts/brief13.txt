#> Operation Ternulon
#> 
#> You have been chosen to carry out this mission based on you psychological
 entrance exams... The main criterion was resistance against the effects of
 sound frequencies on human brain, specifically against the effects of an
 artefact codenamed Silence. Several weeks ago, the scientist researching this
 artefact have decided that its value for Toricon is so great that it will be
 safer to continue the research in Tankred laboratories. The corporation sent
 a special helicopter to transport Silence. However the pilot has been
 captured with the entire crew while refuelling on the northern coast of
 Lebaran and Silence is currently located in fort Satran on Ternulon, one of
 the Wenill Islands. Your task is to capture the island and recover the
 artefact from the enemy. If the Consortium tries to use the artefact against
 you, nothing should happen. The frequencies produced by the artefact affect
 some individuals too weakly to control them in any way.
#> The navy has provided us with cruisers and transport ships so their job is
 getting you to the island. Your job is everything else...
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Capture the island where the artefact is held, capture
 the surrounding islands
