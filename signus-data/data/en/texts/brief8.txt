#> The Defense Department has decided that the best defense is offense. We
 need to strike at one of Consortium's sources of power - capture the Sotorat
 seaport in Hedar. Our intelligence on the strategic value of Sotorat for the
 enemy is as follows: Both warships and transport ships which carry weapons,
 ammunition, etc. to other coastal areas dock there. From this we have
 concluded that there must be either an enormous munitions depot or a weapons
 factory nearby. If we eliminate Sotorat, the Consortium will lose one of its
 main supply points. It would be better to get Sotorat under our control with
 minimal damage, of course, but HQ expects that Consortium forces have orders
 to detonate the whole seaport if their defense line gets breached and
 continue the battle from ships.
#> The only viable way to attack Sotorat is from land. Your first objective
 after fighting your way through to the river are the docks. Not destroying
 them but capturing them and using the ships moored there in battle. Until the
 defenders fall...
