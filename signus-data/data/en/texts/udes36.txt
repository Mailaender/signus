#> Lagoon is an aircraft carrier. It is armed with anti-aircraft machine gun
 but has no other armaments. It has only light armor but it is fairly tough.
#> The primary weapon of these ships are their aircrafts. Lagoon is able to
 carry up to 5 Saturn heavy bombers or 12 Icarus fighters. The greatest
 weakness of these ships is their insufficient armament which means that they
 can be deployed only in the rear lines with destroyer escorts.
