#> Oasis is a transport ship. It has no armament and only light armor.
#> The need for this unit arose in prolonged combat missions which required
 transport of larger regiments. Its deployment in live combat zones is out of
 the question. Instead, Oasis must be protected by war ships at all times.
 However, keeping other units too close to Oasis is dangerous because a direct
 hit may cause explosion that will severely damage all ships in vicinity.
#> The atmosphere aboard Oasis does not resemble in any way the peace and calm
 that someone unfamiliar with the combat conditions in Signus forces might
 imagine.
