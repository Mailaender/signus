#> We have landed on Penytras shore and launched the attack as ordered. During
 the operation it turned out that the intel about military presence on the
 island was wrong. We met strong resistance and then faced mostly
 counterattacks from enemy forces which unexpectedly outnumbered us. However,
 thanks to the experience and abilities of the Signus commando, we have
 managed to capture the island despite heavy casualties.
