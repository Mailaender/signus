 #p.toricon.282.183. 
#> Batix base
#> Situation report: Consortium forces have depolyed their units around Batix
 and we are expecting them to launch the attack at any moment. We have the
 latest, only recently tested prototype weapons stored here in Batix and we
 also serve as a standard munitions and ordnance storage for Toricon strike
 forces.
#> Surrender is out of the question for these reasons. Your task is to defend
 the fortress until reinforcements arrive. If you fail, the Consortium will
 gain new, much stronger weapons against Toricon than it already has.
#> Unfortunately, we cannot use those weapons for defense because Toricon has
 ordered us to keep them secret. If we lose, the prototypes must be destroyed
 together with all testing documents.
#> That is all I will tell you about this matter. The less you know, the less
 you can tell...
