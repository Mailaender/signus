#> Despite minor difficulties, we have successfully accomplished the mission
 to neutralize the Setrix base in west Lebaran. Thus we have managed to cut
 off Consortium forces from access to Toricon's Lebaran territories, in
 particular the forbidden Zone. The connection between Setrix and Kytan was
 destroyed during the battle, Consortium forces have blown up the tracks. We
 have the situation fully under control now.
