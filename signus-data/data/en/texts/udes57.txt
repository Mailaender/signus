#> The Ghytu corporation has a monopoly on building and running the
 Derken-Hamit type repair bays which are the only ones that can repair all
 Signus ground units. This corporation is recognized as strictly neutral by
 both sides of the conflict, thus you will find its repair bays in both
 Toricon and Consortium installations. Use of Ghytu repair services is
 governed by a billing contract which does not permit large-scale usage.
 Service pricing is secret and only officers in the rank of captain or higher
 can get access to it. All units have strict standing orders not to attack
 repair bays. Only the mission commander - captain or higher - may override
 this order and the damages to Ghytu corporation will then be covered from his
 own budget.
#> HQ reports: "The neutrality agreement does not prohibit capturing these
 buildings!"
