#> Gargantua is an artefact transporter. It has a storage compartment
 consisting of the containment chamber itself (protected by strong magnetic
 field) and a small fully automated chemical laboratory. It has weak armor and
 no armament.
#> This behemoth is completely useless as a weapon. On the contrary, Gargantua
 must be kept out of enemy weapons range at all times because even a single
 shot from light cannon can pierce the thin armor and set off the chemicals
 used to neutralize the artefact, causing an explosion that will destroy all
 units in vicinity. Another major weakness of this unit is its low speed.
 Despite all its flaws, Gargantua is still the only transporter capable of
 carrying artefacts.
#> HQ reports: "During manufacturing of this transporter, the chief chemist
 Dr. Daenne has mysteriously disappeared. We strongly suspect that he was
 kidnapped by Consortium spies."
