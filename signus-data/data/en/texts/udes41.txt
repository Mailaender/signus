#> Mystic is a fight-bomber developed using ancient Arkonian technology. It is
 armed with air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground missiles and a heavy machine
 gun.
#> It is possibly the most powerful combat aircraft ever. Pilots appreciate
 Mystic for its speed and high maneuverability in which it outranks even the
 Icarus fighters, making it an especially dangerous opponent in aerial
 battles. It is also very effective in air-to-ground combat. Its missiles are
 deadly and Mystic itself can quickly retreat out of range of enemy air
 defense.
#> Although this is not the first unit developed using ancient Arkonian
 technology, it is the first one to be called an artefact generation design
 due to its capabilities.
