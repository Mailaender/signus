#> The last pocket of Consortium resistance is the central fortress in south
 Lystonia - Trufat. The last step towards restoring peace depends on you. On
 the strength of your resolve, on the power of your will, and of course - on
 your abilities. In the last couple of weeks, the enemy has gathered its
 remaining forces, which are quite numerous, in Trufat. Due to unforeseeable
 events, we have lost the advantage of superior numbers - a significant part
 of our military forces has been withdrawn to Dalio, Lebrukon and other areas
 to deal with the issue of mercenary gangs once and for all. The Signus squad
 assigned to protect the team of scientists in the Eutanian Zone will also not
 come. The squad is actually reported missing#001.
#> Fortunately, we do not expect that the Consortium could somehow turn the
 current situation in its favor. In this operation, Toricon is primarily
 concerned about time - the time separating Arkonis from the final peace...
