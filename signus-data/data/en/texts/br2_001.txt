#> Report by Dr. Hans Iceberg
#> Ardenor base (February 26, 6:38:00 PM)
 #p.br_taron.274.204.
#> Six hours after receiving the Taron artefact, professor Stevens unsealed
 the containment. Eight seconds later, he was overcome by rage for unknown
 reason in which he turned against his assisting colleagues J. Barkli and D.
 Johnson. Despite being unarmed, prof. Stevens killed both of them with a
 single hit to the neck. With nobody else in the room to attack, prof. Stevens
 then began destroying research notes and lab equipment.
#> The lab was completely destroyed in an instant. Nine minutes after the
 outburst began, we managed to subdue the professor and move him to an
 isolation cell. Investigation of the cause or motive of prof. Stevens'
 behavior is still ongoing.
#> A similar incident has happened today during cleanup of the lab. One of the
 janitors was collecting broken pieces of equipment in the immediate vicinity
 of Taron. A few seconds later, he was struck by a similar bout of insanity as
 prof. Stevens. Fortunately, there were no more casualties as the janitor was
 restrained in time.
#> In both cases the rage has faded away in a few hours and the subjects have
 lost memory of the events after a short loss of consciousness. After
 consulting with Dr. B. Lex I came to the conclusion that Taron is responsible
 for these incidents. We have temporarily forbidden access to the artefact for
 this reason and we are awaiting further instructions.
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> Fifteen  hours after the second incident, we have received orders to
 transfer the artefact to the better equipped and protected laboratory in
 Tankred. The research of Taron's effects on human psyche will continue there.
 According to one hypothesis, we may have discovered some kind of defensive
 system from early period of the ancient civilisation. However, more research
 is needed to confirm the hypothesis. Sealing the artefact back into
 containment and other preparations for transport were uneventful, except for
 some visible signs of anxiety among the soldiers most likely caused by
 previous incidents. (For safety, I've recommended changing the transporter
 driver every twenty minutes in case that Taron containment happens to be
 insufficient.)
