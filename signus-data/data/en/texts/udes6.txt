#> Scorpion is a light rocket launcher armed with four missiles for ground
 target barrage. It is equipped with the standard Hackler launcher system also
 used by the regular army.
#> As the name suggests, it is a unit designed for eliminating enemy forces
 from a safe distance. Its armor is optimized for this purpose and cannot
 withstand a direct hit from a tank but allows Scorpion to quickly relocate to
 strategically advantageous positions (and also escape from the range of enemy
 forces). The biggest weakness of this unit is the low storage capacity for
 missiles, which means that effective sustained barrage requires frequent
 resupply from munitions transporters - Gnomes.
#> It is an open secret that Scorpion development was funded by the Trakhal
 corporation which gained the right to buy sixteen Graziy attack helicopters
 from Toricon for business purposes in exchange.
