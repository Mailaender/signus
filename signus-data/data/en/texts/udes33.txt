#> Poseidon is a heavy cruiser. It is armed with a heavy gun, four torpedoes
 and an anti-aircraft gun. It has strong armor and an excellent sensor array
 Akai.
#> These ships are the equivalent of heavy tanks on sea, although Poseidons
 have unquestionably longer range and higher firepower. They are some of the
 most destructive units in existence and together with Viking escort squadrons
 form the backbone of Toricon navy. Their greatest weakness is that they're
 defenseless against enemy submarines unless they're escorted by destroyers.
#> Kliatron, the predecessor of Poseidon, was originally a light cruiser.
 However, its original configuration did not satisfy the requirements for use
 in the Signus forces so its light gun was removed and replaced with the much
 more destructive Drake.
