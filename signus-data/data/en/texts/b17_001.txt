#> Excerpt from Prof. Dietel's diary, fort Trufat
#> 
#> It appears that fortune has sided with Toricon for now. The enemy has
 breached our coastal defenses this morning and even the line of fortified
 outposts could not stop their advance. The Consortium is fighting fiercely
 for every inch of its remaining territory, and although the forces on both
 sides appear to be evenly matched, Toricon is slowly but surely getting
 closer to the fortress. There might still be a chance to avert the impending
 defeat if our navy could break the continental blockade. No supply ship with
 food has reached Lystonia for several weeks and supplies in the fortress will
 last only two months at best unless a miracle happens. In a way, it's all
 quite absurd. Giant fortress the size of a city, with top-class weaponry,
 huge garrison of soldiers, simply everything you can think of, and it can do
 nothing but wait. One last hope are our forces in northern Rotenalia. If they
 manage to get some food supplies from the civilians by any means and bring
 them into the fortress before Toricon lays siege to us...
