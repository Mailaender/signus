#> Caesar is a transport aircraft. It has medium armor and no armament.
 It is powered by two tiltjet engines allowing vertical take-off.
#> Caesar was originally designed as a heavy bomber but it was obsoleted in
 this role when the Saturn entered service. Thus the existing planes were
 refitted for the transport role and now they serve in the airborne division
 of Signus forces. Their use in combat missions is somewhat limited by their
 low toughness, therefore we recommend deploying Caesars only with escort by
 Icarus and Mystic fighters.
#> All Caesar-class aircrafts belong to the marine headquarters which caused
 some issues with their deployment in missions commanded by the strategic air
 force. However, we are now happy to report that there are no more conflicts
 within our forces. - Defense Department's report to the Board of Directors.
