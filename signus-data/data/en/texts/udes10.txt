#> Patriot is a light self-propelled howitzer using explosive ammunition
 of the same caliber as medium tanks (Perseus Beta). It has limited armor and
 no short-range weapons.
#> This unit is designed for shelling enemy forces from behind the lines using
 its long-range gun mounted on Patriot 3K chassis. However, the trade-off
 for Patriot's mobility is its fragility.
#> Patriot is one of the few Signus units also used by the regular army (under
 the designation KH-12C). The most famous proponent of the KHs is general
 Esencki (one of the founders of the Signus forces), who successfully defended
 a ford across the Astra river during a Toricon military exercise using only
 the second and fourth artillery regiment of the third division composed
 mainly of KHs against three tank divisions commanded by general Westen.
