#> Perseus Alpha is based on the standard army RT 29 tank. It is equipped with
 a light unbuffered short-range gun. Its main advantage is high mobility.
#> Due to its low firepower, deployment only in larger battlegroups is
 advised. Assault squads composed of these units can be quickly moved to
 strategically advantageous positions thanks to high mobility. It also proved
 to be effective at eliminating long-range weapons located deep behind enemy
 lines.
#> It is historically the first unit deployed in the Signus forces. Designers
 warn that its weak armor is a significant disadvantage. That is one of the
 reasons why we expect to partially replace it with other unit types in the
 future.
