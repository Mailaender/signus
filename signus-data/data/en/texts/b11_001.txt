#> Welcome to Tridi Vision war news...
#> 
#> First, an overview of the latest clashes between the warring sides:
#> Losabo:
#> - Toricon navy has finally managed to break through the continental
 blockade after six weeks and sink a large part of the blockading fleet. They
 have the situation in Losabo fully under control again.
#> Hedar:
#> - Toricon is slowly but surely regaining its original territory here as
 well. Their elite forces have captured several cities near the coast this
 morning. Only the central part of Hedar province remains under Consortium
 control and it seems to be only a matter of time before they lose this area
 completely.
#> Lebrukon and Dalio:
#> - These provinces look as if a hurricane has passed through, or at least
 that's how our reporter describes the situation...
#> Bomb craters, buildings on fire, burnt corpses of soldiers and civilians...
 In a word: havoc...
#> People of the whole world condemn Toricon's brutal attack. Toricon
 justifies its actions by an alleged Consortium plan to invade Lebaran.
 Civilians caught in this private war between the two giant corporations can
 only ask: "How far will they go in this pointless feud...?"
