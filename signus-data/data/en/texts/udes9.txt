#> Goliath is a heavy mobile long-range artillery unit using high-explosive
 ammunition based on artefact technology. The chassis and gun are made of
 special alloy in order withstand the extreme temperatures reached when firing.
#> Goliath has almost the same combat limitations as the Hercules heavy rocket
 launcher. It cannot be deployed in the front line and must be protected by
 tanks and anti-aircraft weapons. Goliath's main advantage over its
 predecessor Hercules is its ammo storage capacity which allows sustained
 barrage even without support from Gnome munitions transporters.
#> "...and so we would like to express our gratitude to our scientists and
 engineers who have produced outstanding results through their hard work and
 tenacity and created a machine which combines the majesty of our predecessors
 on Arkonis with the ingenuity of human intellect." - excerpt from Ian
 Zening's speech to scientists
