#> Barracuda is a submarine developed using artefact technology. It is armed
 with a special torpedo launcher.
#> One of the major advantages of these submarines is their sensor array which
 allows them to detect any enemy unit. Their main disadvantage is that they
 can be easily detected by the Viking destroyers. Barracudas must surface to
 fire their guns which makes them very vulnerable.
#> There had been a minor problem with pressure chambers during the
 development of these submarines. Fortunately, we managed to resolve it before
 it caused any significant loss of life.
