#> Messiah is a long-range artillery gun on train chassis. It is of similar
 design as the Goliath but it doesn't use any artefact technology.
#> The main advantage of these units is their extreme range and firepower
 which tops even the Goliath's. Their biggest weakness are the limitations
 stemming from their weight which can be carried only by a train chassis, thus
 restricting their mobility to railroad tracks. Another Messiah's major
 weakness is its thin armor which precludes its deployment in the front line.

 in the name of the Messiah." - "Sibyl's Prophecy" - found in the databases of
 colony ships.
