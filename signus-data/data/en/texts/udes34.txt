#> Kraken is a battleship. It is armed with a heavy gun of similar design as
 that of the Goliath but with much higher firepower. Secondary weapons include
 torpedoes and a heavy anti-aircraft gun.
#> This heavily armored behemoth is by far the most destructive unit in the
 Signus forces. Its biggest weakness is the weak anti-aircraft gun which
 necessitates destroyer escort for effective air defense. Kraken's second
 major weakness is its poor sensor array which cannot detect enemy submarines.
#> "There are only two ways to sink the Kraken: The first one is to shoot it
 down and the second one are all the others." - quote from an anonymous
 engineer.
