#> Skiatron is a light radar vehicle with no armament and weak armor. It uses
 the Atron IFF radar system developed specifically for Signus forces.
#> As the designation suggests, this is not a combat unit but a support
 vehicle intended for deployment with long-range artillery such as Hercules
 and Goliath and designating targets within their attack range. However,
 Skiatron can be deployed only in the rear lines under protection by tanks and
 anti-aircraft weapons just like the artillery units.
#> Skiatron was named after the city Ski-Ata-Rona, the birthplace of James
 Astrand, the greatest secret agent of all time and the author of books
 "The Silent Truth" and "Two Noble Words". Ski-Ata-Rona now provides its
 agents to both Toricon and Consortium.
