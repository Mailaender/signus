#> Based on comparing tremor intensity in the desert area of Eutanian
 forbidden Zone, we have determined the location that should be the epicenter
 of the earthquakes. Our research expedition has found a whole complex of
 strange elongated mushroom-shaped buildings at that location. Furthermore, in
 the middle of this "city" was an ancient Arkonian pyramid almost untouched by
 time. The ground around the city trembles in regular intervals and a long
 peculiar tone sounds throughout the desert. Shortly after setting up camp,
 Prof. Lottenbert took command of the exploration. Thanks to him, we have
 found the source of the peculiar noise and the cause of the uneasy feeling
 that we couldn't shake off.
#> The strange buildings resonate with the tremors and produce a song-like
 sound. This "singing" is accompanied by extremely low-frequency tones which
 are outside human range of hearing but affect our subconscious. The main goal
 of this scientific expedition is to find entrance into the pyramid and
 discover its true purpose.
