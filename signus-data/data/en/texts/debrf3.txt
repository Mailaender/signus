#> We have successfully captured Arten and subsequently Sanukor as ordered.
 Both are now under our control and we are awaiting further orders.
#> Regarding documents about discovered artefacts: In Sanukor we have found
 only mentions of artefacts being transported farther away to Tortugal base in
 west Eutania. Artefacts from Arten were most likely transported to the same
 location.
