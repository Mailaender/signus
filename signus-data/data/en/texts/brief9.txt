 #p.toricon.282.183. 
#> You have volunteered to carry out a mission which is vitally important for
 Toricon's very existence but taking part in it means almost certain death...
#> The research division has discovered an artefact#001 (currently held by the
 Consortium) whose destructive power can, if wielded by an expert, disrupt the
 functioning of our weapons, including those developed using artefact
 technology. The artefact is currently being transported from Sotona to fort
 Trufat in central Lystonia. Since capturing this fortress is beyond our power
 at least in the foreseeable future, you must ambush the convoy escorting the
 artefact at least by the time it crosses the ice belt on Sotona border.
#> Our scouts report that the convoy is heavily armed but our chances to
 secure the artefact are much higher on the road than at the walls of Trufat.
#> Your only objective is to get the artefact out of enemy hands, even if you
 have to destroy it. If the artefact explodes, it'll obliterate all life in
 the radius of several dozen meters, thus it is in your own interest to
 achieve the best possible outcome.
#> If you do not survive this mission, rest assured that your death was not in
 vain.
