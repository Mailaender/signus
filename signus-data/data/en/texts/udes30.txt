#> Ganymedes is a support train, essentially a combination of Ceres, Gnome and
 Iris on rails. It has no armaments and only thin armor.
#> The designers of this highly explosive unit warn that if Ganymedes gets
 destroyed, the tracks will need to be rebuilt. Therefore we recommend against
 deploying this unit in front-line combat. Ganymedes can of course support
 non-train units as well. Since air strikes pose the greatest threat to
 Ganymedes, we recommend keeping it under protection by Phalanges at all
 times.
#> The Defense Department had a long dispute with the Board of Directors about
 the need for these units. However, Ian Zening had his way in the end.
