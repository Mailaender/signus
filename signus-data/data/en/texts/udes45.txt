#> Satan is a self-propelled high-explosive bomb developed using ancient
 Arkonian technology. Its casing contains an anti-gravity engine which allows
 it to hover freely above ground. Its main weapon is explosive self-destruct.
 In addition, it is armed with a mortar for shelling targets at a distance.
#> The biggest weakness of this artefact-based weapon is its low toughness
 which makes it vulnerable to all enemy units. On the other hand, Satan's
 greatest advantage is its incredibly destructive explosive charge which can
 destroy all life and objects within an area equal to Perseus Beta's firing
 range.
#> Even some high-ranking officers objected to development of this weapon.
 However, its deployment then became a necessity.
#> Special feature: Satan cannot be targeted by return fire.
