#> The mission went according to plan. The valley is secured and enemy forces
 eliminated. On our way back to Trix we were caught in an earthquake#001 and
 clouds of mist started rising out of the ground. At first we thought it was
 some new technology developed by the Consortium or something like that but
 the leaking gases caused no harmful effects.
#> There were no other issues on the way after that.
