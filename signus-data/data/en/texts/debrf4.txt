#> Reinforcements from the Tetron base where we sent a distress call shortly
 before the Consortium attack have arrived during the battle for Batix. With
 their help, we have managed to repel the invasion force and we are currently
 collecting the dead and treating the wounded. Scouts report that the enemy is
 doing the same while slowly retreating back to Tortugal where they came from.
