#> We have been trying to capture the Taluon base for the past two days but
 they have managed to fend off our attacks up until now. We have informed
 Toricon about the current situation and agreed on the only available
 solution...
#> That solution are the sonic tanks currently stationed in Toricon base Tulos
 a few miles from here.
#> The fastest and also the only viable way to bring the tanks to the front
 lines is the Tubar bridge. We have this access point to Taluon under our
 control for now but we can expect that the enemy has already guessed our next
 move and will launch a major pinpoint attack to capture or destroy the bridge
 at any moment. Your task is to keep Taluon forces away from the bridge and if
 they get too close, prevent any attempts to destroy it. We must keep the
 bridge under our control at any cost, otherwise we will lose the ability to
 deploy sonic tanks and breach the Taluon defensive perimeter. We know it,
 they know it... So get ready for the worst...

 capture the Consortium base Taluon
