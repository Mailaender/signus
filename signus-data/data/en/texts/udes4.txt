#> Dirrac is a sonic tank developed using ancient Arkonian technology. It is
 equipped with a sonic gun utilizing ultrasonic waves and has strong armor.
#> In essence, it is a light tank with high mobility, which together with its
 high firepower makes it effective against long-range weapons located deep
 behind enemy lines. Another advantage of this unit is its thick front armor
 which puts it on equal footing with the much heavier Perseus Gamma tanks.
 However, its biggest weakness is insufficient top armor which makes it
 vulnerable to missile fire.
#> Due to incomplete understanding of the technology, this unit has some
 undesirable effects on its crew's psyche so only the most mentally resilient
 soldiers can become Dirrac pilots after an arduous training. Thus you can
 recognize Dirrac crewmembers by their slightly yellowish irises.
