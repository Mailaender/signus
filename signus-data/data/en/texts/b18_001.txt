#> Welcome to Tridi Vision war news.
#> 
#> The last gunshots marking the victory of Toricon in the biggest battle in
 the history of Arkonis have ceased a few hours ago. Although the Consortium
 has suffered an undeniable defeat in this battle, the war is not yet over.
 Rotenalian forces have snuck inside Trufat while the deadly battle was raging
 eight miles to the north and solved the issue of insufficient food supplies
 that the fortress would face in case of siege. The victory of the attacking
 side is therefore not as clear as it seemed right after the battle.
#> The dead are currently being buried in mass graves and combat units are
 moving towards Trufat. The special forces known under the codename Signus are
 expected to be deployed in the very likely last battle of the war. Toricon
 was using them mainly for small-scale surprise attacks, weapon prototypes
 testing, etc. According to unconfirmed rumors, they played a major role in
 the so-called Amenur massacre which became the cause for declaration of open
 war.
