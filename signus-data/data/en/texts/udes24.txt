#> Spectrum is a laser turret developed using artefact technology. It has
 excellent armor developed in the Corporation's secret laboratories.
#> Its strong armor shields sensitive mechanisms which makes it somewhat
 vulnerable. Its short range makes it defenseless against enemy long-range
 weapons. Spectrum is therefore used mainly in larger bases as part of complex
 defensive layouts together with Minotaurs, Horizons and other turret types.
 Deploying Spectrums along retreat paths may also be advantageous in order to
 slow down the advancement of enemy forces.
#> Spectrum crews are drafted from Aweldan hussars who operate the Frector
 long-range turrets in the regular army.
