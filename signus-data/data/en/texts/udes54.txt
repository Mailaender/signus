#> The depot contains an enormous amount of ammunition (including supplies for
 its production) and fuel used to resupply the Cereses, Gnomes and other
 units. It is a structure with the lowest level of automation and the only one
 that contains no command center. All facilities inside a depot are fully
 self-contained, thus the Boomerang commandos must capture and reprogram each
 of them separately.
