#> Phalanx is a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun. It is armed with a heavy
 machine gun for attacking ground targets and twin anti-aircraft gun. It has
 rather weak armor.
#> Phalanx was designed and built as a mobile anti-air support unit. As a
 result, it has rather low firepower and is effective only when deployed in
 larger batteries or in conjunction with the Horizon anti-aircraft turrets.
 On the other hand, these units are exceptionally mobile which allows them to
 rapidly move to areas under threat. The major weakness of these units is
 their weak armor which makes them an easy target for the Rex helicopters.
#> The symbol of these units are 4 raised spears representing a defensive
 formation using its long spears to protect themselves and their companions.
