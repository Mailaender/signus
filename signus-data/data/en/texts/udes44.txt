#> Rex is an attack helicopter. It is armed with air-to-ground missile
 launcher and heavy anti-aircraft machine gun. It is powered by large
 six-blade rotor.
#> The primary purpose of this unit is elimination of ground targets using its
 fragmentation rockets. In aerial combat, Rex must rely on ground anti-air
 batteries or fighter pilot colleagues. It is a unit designed for front-line
 combat along with tanks and defense turrets. Its role is to paralyze enemy
 ground forces and then (in case of too strong enemy air defense or fighter
 squadron counterattack) retreat back to safety behind friendly lines.
#> "This helicopter was the first unit to serve in the Signus air force.
 Consortium forces have demonstrated its merits to us in past battles." -
