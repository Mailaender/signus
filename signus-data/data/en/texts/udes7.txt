#> Hercules is a heavy rocket launcher equipped with Pluton launcher system.
 Pluton can carry up to six missiles and launch them at targets up to two
 miles away.
#> The rapid development of this unit was sparked by frequent reports from
 senior officers whose forces had encountered enemy long-range turrets -
 Minotaurs. And thus was created a unit with longer range than the Minotaur.
 However, Hercules has weak armor and limited missile storage capacity just
 like the Scorpion which means it can be deployed only in the rear lines with
 support from Gnomes. The great advantage of Hercules are its fragmentation
 missiles which allow hitting a larger area with just one shot.
#> Press announcement: "By order of the supreme commander, the Hercules
 long-range rocket launcher was tested in the rocky desert of Hibog which is
 completely UNINHABITED! Any news reports to the contrary are fake and nothing
 more than Consortium propaganda."
