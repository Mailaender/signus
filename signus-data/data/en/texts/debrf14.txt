#> We tried to hold the bridge until reinforcements arrive as ordered and
 succeeded despite heavy casualties. Once the sonic tanks crossed the bridge,
 we began our advance on the enemy base. Shortly after breaching the defensive
 perimeter, our forces have entered Taluon. We are currently rebuilding the
 defensive perimeter since the sonic tanks are returning back to Tulos.
 Everything will be ready by the time the helicopter with Prof. Lottenbert#001
 lands here.
