#> Rufion base
#> We have finally received some news about the missing transport ship
 Queen#001.
#> The ship, which was supposed to arrive a day and a half ago, was captured
 by the Consortium 15 miles from the Retan Bay and then it was sunk together
 with an enemy warship shortly afterwards.
#> Upon our request, Toricon has already dispatched another ship for the
 artefacts stored at Rufion. However, we cannot estimate when it'll arrive due
 to a hurricane raging at the sea.
#> What makes the situation even worse, the Consortium has lauched an
 operation at the eastern shore of Koner Bay right after the above-mentioned
 incident...
#> Several regiments are currently heading to our position. Their objective is
 likely to capture our artefacts.
#> Rufion has sent a distress signal to nearby bases. Only Ardenor has
 responded so far, promising reinforcements. We have also managed to contact
 Toricon HQ for a few moments and they're asking us to do the impossible -
 specifically: We have received orders to hold our position until
 reinforcements arrive, then transport the artefacts to the seaport where a
 ship will be waiting for us.
#> I don't need to remind you that we don't stand a chance without
 reinforcements to cover our back so let's hope they will arrive in time...
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Defend the base until reinforcements arrive, then
 transport the artefacts to the transport ship
