#> A few hours ago, air reconnaissance has discovered sudden Consortium
 activity within Eutania. A group of geologists has been attacked while doing
 scientific research for Toricon.
#> The strike took place in central Eutanian forbidden Zone, in the area where
 a group of scientists led by professor Lottenbert had been exploring an
 ancient Arkonian city at the time. The area is currently under full control
 of the Consortium. Toricon demands immediate counterattack in order to
 recapture the occupied territory as soon as possible. Top management is
 worried that the Consortium might discover new and much more destructive
 artefacts than those found so far and use them to turn the tide of the war.
#> The operation will take place in the extreme conditions of barren desert,
 that's why we have chosen you - the special ops unit of Signus.
#> The main objective is to capture the City#001. But under any circumstances
 it must not, I repeat, it must NOT be destroyed. The fate of the entire world
 may depend on its existence.
