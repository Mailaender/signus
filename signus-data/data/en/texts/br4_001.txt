#> I don't like this place, I really don't like it...
#> We're trapped in here. Consortium soldiers are all around us and they keep
 tightening the circle around the base. It feels as if they were tightening a
 noose around my neck.
#> They're advancing slowly but surely as if they knew how does it make us
 feel.
#> We've lost the fortified outpost by the bridge a few minutes ago. I have a
 dreadful feeling that my cousin George Hastings was on duty there today. I'll
 probably never see him again. Not alive.
#> The boys are getting nervous. No wonder, we've never been in such dire
 straits as far as I can remember.
#> If only we could use the new weapons that Toricon had us test. Without
 them, we'll probably all kick the bucket here. Our last hope are the
 reinforcements coming from Tetron, unless Bronx just made them up.
