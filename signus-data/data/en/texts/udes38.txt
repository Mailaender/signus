#> Icarus is an air superiority fighter. It is armed with Omega air-to-air
 missiles and a heavy machine gun for short-range combat. The jet engines for
 these units are manufactured my the Asterkhel corporation.
#> The main use for these fighters is in aerial battles where they can defeat
 even much better armed and armored opponents thanks to their speed and fairly
 decent missile firepower. A major advantage of these planes is their fairly
 long flight range which allows them to fly deep behind enemy lines to escort
 bombers. Their weakness is low toughness so they can withstand only a few
 hits.
#> "The Asterkhel corporation was granted permission to manufacture its own
 fighter aircrafts and we can expect that it is the first step toward the
 anarchy that corporations wish for." - a newspaper excerpt
