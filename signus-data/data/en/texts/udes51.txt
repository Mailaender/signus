#> All bases used by Signus forces are built with similar layout as base
 Mahakam. Each base has a control center where the commanding officer - a
 captain - is stationed with his three-member advisory team which supervises
 the functioning of the otherwise fully automated base. The supervision is
 intermittent because bases can operate completely autonomously even without
 human intervention.
#> The core of the base is the so-called Hangar which contains fuel pumps for
 refueling combat vehicles, ammunition loaders and repair units. All of these
 devices are completely autonomous and do not require any human to operate
 them. They are powered by solar cells located on the roof of the base.
#> Bases are equipped with a security system know as "The Seal", just like
 radars, depots and factories. This system ensures that enemy units will not
 be allowed to enter the compound. Unfortunately, the Boomerang scout vehicles
 are able to "break" this seal.
