#> As ordered, we tried to defend the base as long as we could. When the
 awaited transport ship was approaching the seaport, we received a distress
 signal from Ardenor base from which we understood that the promised
 reinforcements are not coming. These dire circumstances forced me to order
 all units to retreat with the artefacts to the seaport.
#> Despite heavy casualties, we have managed to board the warship Artemis and
 now the few of us who have survived are heading to Tankred.
#> Rufion was captured by the enemy. Ardenor, which was attacked by the
 Consortium even before they besieged Rufion, also has no chance.
#> However, the main objective of this mission - loading the artefacts on
 Artemis, was accomplished...
