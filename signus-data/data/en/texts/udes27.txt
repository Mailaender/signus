#> Olympus is a transport train with chassis designed to carry up to 130 tons of
 cargo without any loss of speed.
#> The primary design goal during development of this train was to maximize
 cargo capacity. This had an impact on both Olympus' mediocre speed and
 insufficient armor. Nevertheless it has proven to be a valuable support unit
 especially in missions where a number of heavy units needs to be delivered to
 distant combat positions.
#> Olympus crews are drafted from the White Wolves commandos better known as
 the suicide commandos, which ensures that these trains cannot be captured by
 enemy forces.
