#> Thor is a missile turret equipped with a single launcher system of similar
 design as the one used by Hercules heavy rocket launcher. Designers have
 developed a new defensive mechanism for this turret which allows it to
 retract underground.
#> This unit is among the most advanced yet - it has long detection range,
 long firing range and rapid rate of fire. Its missiles can hit targets up to
 1.5 miles away. Thor is a devastating weapon but the price for its firepower
 is weak armor. It is very vulnerable when not retracted.
#> HQ reports: "...therefore we issue an order to find and punish the vandals
 who sprayed 'Ostrich' on the Thor turret."
