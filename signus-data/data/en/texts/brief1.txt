#> Our intelligence division has found out that the Consortium is developing a
 new and significantly improved tank model most likely intended for service in
 special forces similar to our Signus#002 commandos. It is necessary to find
 as much information about this tank as possible and give it to the research
 division.
#> We've managed to capture one of these tanks in a recent army operation and
 sent it immediately for thorough examination. However, our intel about the
 Perseus#001 Beta#001 project is still insufficient. It was decided that we
 need to test the tank in real combat. Yesterday (February 23rd), a routine
 reconnaissance flight has discovered a secret Consortium base on the west
 coast of Arvish province. The pictures clearly show a couple of Betas parking
 nearby.
 #p.brmap1.152.128.
#> The mission of your strike force is to land on the beach west of the base,
 capture the base and crush any resistance from Consortium army. Intel
 indicates that enemy forces in the area are limited. If you move quickly
 enough, you should be able to capture the base before the Consortium can
 evacuate it.
#> Transport to the landing zone will be provided by regular army transport
 ships.
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Eliminate enemy forces in the area
#> SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: Capture the Consortium base and Perseus Beta tanks
