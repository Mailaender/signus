#> Welcome to Tridi Vision news.
#> Our war reporters describe the situation as follows: Toricon has now
 recovered from the surprise attack and it is mobilising all forces. They are
 trying to prevent the incursion of Consortium forces further into their
 territory, with some success. Since the hostilities began, Toricon has lost
 the following territories: Sotona, Lebrukon and Dalio.
#> Battle still rages in Rotenalia where Toricon has destroyed the Amenur
 village, with neither side getting closer to victory. A similar situation is
 currently in Hedar where Toricon has managed to regain almost half of its
 initial territory.
#> Peace remains for now in Lystonia, on the Penytras island owned by the
 Consortium and also in Toricon territories of Misteral archipelago, central
 Eutania and Losabo.
#> Elite units are carrying out smaller operations in the Zones.
#> See you soon with more Tridi Vision news.
