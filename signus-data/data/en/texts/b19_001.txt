#> Toricon research outpost, Eutanian forbidden Zone
#> 
#> Late at night, around 11:30 P.M., an unusually strong earthquake occurred
 in the center of the City. A surprising event then took place during damage
 assessment - the pyramid started to spontaneously open up and a thunder-like
 sound filled the area. Recordings from our instruments show that it was a
 different frequency than the City usually produces.
#> Some kind of mist spread out from inside the pyramid and engulfed the whole
 camp. Once the initial panic subsided and analysis of the mist showed that it
 was harmless, we have ventured to enter the pyramid. We must have spent at
 least several hours inside but once we have returned back to camp, nobody
 could remember what happened during that time. We were left only with a vague
 feeling that we are no longer alone in the City...
