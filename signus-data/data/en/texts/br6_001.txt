#> Since the target area we are looking for should be of similar size as an
 average village and far out of sight of the media, I recommend the Amenur
 village in the northern part of the desert area of Rotenalia.
#> Aside from the convenient location, there is also another benefit from
 wiping Amenur off the map along with its inhabitants...
#> As we have known for a while, Amenur is the center of a sect worshipping
 the ancient Arkonian civilization. A few weeks ago, this sect has publicly
 condemned Toricon, accusing us of desecrating the ancient civilization.
#> They most likely talked about Toricon's artefact research, which they have
 learned about either by chance, e.g. one of them witnessed artefact
 excavation from the ruins or a similar operation, or they have a member in
 one of our garrisons.
#> If such accusations get into the media, it might damage Toricon's public
 relations. Considering the importance of the research, we cannot afford that.
 Absolute secrecy is especially important for the Goliath operation as the
 Consortium might use the destruction of Amenur as a pretext for greater PR
 offensive against Toricon, etc.
