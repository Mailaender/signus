#> Saturn is a heavy bomber equipped with 6 sets of bombs for carpet bombing.
 It has no armaments for air-to-air combat and only thin armor.
#> This bomber is among the few weapons that can significantly damage the
 Kraken battleship. Saturn's carpet bombs have turned the tide of battle more
 than once before. However, these heavy planes must be escorted by fighters
 because they have low durability despite their size and no weapons for
 air-to-air combat, thus even the light Icarus can shoot these behemoths down
 easily. Another disadvantage is their low bomb capacity which forces them to
 return back to base for reload after each drop.
#> Deployment of these units had surprisingly stirred opposition from the
 Amaldon humanist movement. However, the protests have ceased after their
 leaders were executed.
