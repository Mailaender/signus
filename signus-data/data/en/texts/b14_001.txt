#> It has been six weeks since the first earthquake events on Arkonis. We have
 installed measuring stations in all locations where the tremors produce
 strange sound detectable only with special equipment. We have detected a
 similar sound produced by one of the artefacts whose purpose we have not been
 able to determine yet. Prof. Lottenbert has put forward a theory that the
 source of the strange sound whose frequency changes in certain repeating
 intervals might be the ancient Arkonian civilization. This civilization had
 been, as we all know, defeated by our ancestors in the battle for Arkonis and
 everyone thought it was extinct up until now. But let's be honest that
 destroying something or someone like that is not really possible. Prof.
 Lottenbert has proposed the idea that the ancient Arkonians are trying to
 establish contact with the human race through these phenomena.
#> According to our measurements, the tremors are strongest near Taluon base
 in central Rotenalia. Unfortunately, that area is controlled by the
 Consortium, therefore we ask Toricon to support our project in which Prof.
 Lottenbert will thoroughly explore possible ways to communicate with the race
 of the Ancients.
