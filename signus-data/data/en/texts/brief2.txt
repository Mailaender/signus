#> We have detected Consortium military activity near our Ardenor base where
 the research of the Taron artefact is taking place. The base will be
 completely surrounded within a few hours.
#> (See Dr.#001 Iceberg's#001 report#001 for details)
#> We have found the explanation of Consortium's sudden attack: A patrol has
 arrested Dr. B. Lex an hour ago in an attempt to defect to the besieging
 army. After thorough interrogation, Dr. Lex admitted his contact with the
 enemy and performing research on Taron for the Consortium which is interested
 in the artefact's effects on human psyche.
#> This change of situation has led the Toricon company to give us an order to
 prevent the attackers from capturing the artefact at all costs and perform
 the planned artefact transport to the new research location IMMEDIATELY. We
 have to draw away Consortium forces and transport the Taron to our Tankred
 base north of Ardenor where our position is secure. Doctor Iceberg will be
 in charge of the entire operation.

#> PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Deliver the Taron artefact to the base in Tankred
