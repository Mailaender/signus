#> Radars have a similar layout to bases, just scaled down. Every radar
 contains a control room operated by a sergeant-engineer who monitors the
 functioning of this fully automated structure. Apart from the control room,
 radars also contain sensors which track the movement of enemy units within
 range and a transmitter which relays this information to the tactical
 displays of friendly units, allowing them to use the element of surprise and
 deliver the first strike.
#> All of these structures are equipped with a security system known as "The
 Seal".
#> Radar is the only thing used by all armies in the exact same configuration.
