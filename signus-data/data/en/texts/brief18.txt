#> Ground forces HQ - ten miles east of fort Trufat
#> A few hours ago, the Consortium has tried to break through the continental
 blockade in the north and secure a part of the coast. The promised
 reinforcements cannot arrive because of that. Moreover, the enemy has
 deployed its ground forces eight miles in front of its central fortress -
 Trufat. Latest reports warn us that a large army with food supplies is coming
 from northern Rotenalia to reinforce the Consortium. If they manage to join
 up with the forces defending the fortress, the siege could stretch out for
 at least several months. In an attempt to buy the time needed for the
 aforementioned army to reach Trufat, the enemy has chosen to engage our
 forces in open field. Toricon has no choice but to accept this challenge
 because the assembled enemy units are blocking further advance inland.
#> Your task is to resolve this, we could say pivotal battle, in our favor.
 We cannot stop the reinforcements from reaching the fortress but if we lose
 the upcoming battle, Toricon can forget about besieging Trufat in the
 foreseeable future, if ever...
