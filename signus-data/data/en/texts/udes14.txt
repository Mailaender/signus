#> Uran is a transporter of combat vehicles. It has standard armor and no
 armament.
#> This unit was originally developed from its lighter Bastien-class
 predecessor used by the marines and was intended only as an insertion
 transporter for larger offensive operations. However, the development of
 heavy artillery units such as Goliath and Hercules created the need for a
 unit capable of delivering them to firing positions or evacuating them from
 locations under threat by the enemy. Thus the Bastien was redesigned into
 Uran. This behemoth can carry up to 4 Hercules heavy rocket launchers and up
 to 12! Perseus Alpha light tanks.
#> Note from general Esencki: "Uran cannot withstand heavy damage, therefore I
 recommend using it for transport only behind the front lines."
