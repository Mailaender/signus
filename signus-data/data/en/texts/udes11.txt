#> Boomerang is a light reconnaissance vehicle with an excellent sensor array.
 Its greatest strength is its speed, the greatest weakness is its weak armor
 and low durability.
#> These units were designed to carry up to five-person commandos inside which
 allow these vehicles to capture enemy buildings (radars, depots and bases).
 This feature makes Boomerangs highly strategically important. Another major
 advantage of Boomerangs is their sensor array which allows them to locate
 enemy forces at considerable distance.
#> Boomerang was originally used as a light assault tank. But this role is
 currently served by Perseus Alpha in assault missions.
