 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> Three months ago, the research team led by Prof. G. Londown had found an
 unusual artefact in the southern part of Sotona forbidden Zone. At first we
 had no idea how to get to its core, all tests and other attempts to identify
 its unique properties failed. Thus we put our seemingly worthless discovery
 aside to the corner of our laboratory and returned to the ongoing earlier
 research of the Pegasus artefact. But we could not measure any activity from
 the artefact anymore. It was as if its effects on gravity just disappeared.
 We also got the same results with other artefacts brought to the laboratory.
 We have accidentally found out that they stop working in the vicinity of
 Prof. Londown's mysterious artefact.
#> Unfortunately, our lab is not equipped for this kind of research. The
 Consortium research department directorate has issued an order to transfer
 the Lord to fort Trufat which also serves as a research base.
