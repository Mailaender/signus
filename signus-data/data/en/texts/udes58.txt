#> Dock is a codename for seaport and shipyard all in one used by Signus
 naval forces. Each "dock" has a control tower which also serves as a
 lighthouse. The commanding officer who reports directly to the captain is
 stationed in the tower. Like all other buildings, docks are fully automated
 and equipped with The Seal. Automation allows them to repair multiple ships
 at the same time. These buildings have a decent radar system which allows
 them to detect enemy forces at a fairly long range. Unfortunately, the radar
 cannot detect enemy submarines, which is why you'll often find destroyers
 patrolling nearby. Just like all other buildings, docks have no armaments and
 must therefore rely on defensive turrets and combat units for protection.
