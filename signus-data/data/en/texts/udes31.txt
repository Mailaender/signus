#> Flint is a gunboat. It is armed with a long-recoil medium gun of a similar
 design as that used by Perseus Beta tanks.
#> It is a support fire unit which can partially substitute medium tanks in
 terrain inaccessible to Perseus Beta tanks. It is one of the weakest navy
 combat units serving in the Signus forces, thus their deployment in naval
 battles is possible only in larger fleets with support from heavier warships.
#> Signus forces have acquired these gunboats from marine squadrons. They are
 named Flint after a colonel who died while defending a bridge from three
 enemy tank battalions using his gunboats.
