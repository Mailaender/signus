#> We have tested Goliath and destroyed Amenur as ordered. Our departure from
 the mission area after completing the objectives was interrupted by
 unexpected landing of elite Consortium forces. They may have a spy in our
 ranks.
#> Our intelligence reports that other Consortium attacks took place in the
 territories of Sotona, Lebrukon, Dalio and Hedar at the same moment. Open
 battles between Consortium and Toricon forces are currently in progress in
 all of these areas.
#> The Consortium is trying to sway public opinion in its favor. They justify
 these attacks by our destruction of Amenur where Consortium supporters were
 in the majority.
