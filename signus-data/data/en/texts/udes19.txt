#> Iris is a repair vehicle developed from Betan 24 used by the regular army.
 It has no armament and only minimal armor.
#> Missions where combat vehicles need to operate at a significant distance
 from the nearest friendly base created the need for a repair vehicle capable
 of repairing damaged units so that they can rejoin the heroic battle in the
 front lines. One of the most important design goals for Iris was high
 mobility.  This led to low durability which doesn't allow it to safely
 operate among front-line combat units.
#> "Iris went through many changes and doesn't resemble its predecessor
 Betan 24 in nearly any way anymore. But they still have one thing in common -
 the mission to help their brothers in arms." - A promotional leaflet
 circulating among Iris pilots.
