#> Agni is a light laser tank of similar design as the Dirrac sonic tanks. It
 is armed with a laser gun and similarly to the "sonics", this unit also has
 fairly strong armor.
#> Agni is designed for nearly identical combat role as the Dirracs. The only
 significant difference between these two units is that Agni has slightly
 stronger armor. Its greatest weakness is the lack of anti-aircraft weapons
 which precludes stand-alone deployment without anti-air support.
#> "...and the Lord of fire shall come and smite Your bodies and souls with
 flame and chase you around and He shall have no mercy with any of You until
 You weep tears of fire and beg for forgiveness" - the 11th verse of the
 Klihiana Epic - describing the end of the world of infidels.
