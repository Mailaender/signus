#> Signus Special Forces
 #p.anamorf.320.184.
#> This project was proposed by Ian Zening - the president of the Defense
 Department. Top leadership embraced it after the first diplomatic clash
 between Toricon and the Consortium. The project became a necessity after it
 was revealed that the Consortium is making exploratory expeditions into
 forbidden Zones within Toricon's sphere of interest.
#> The goal is to create an elite unit - the Signus Special Forces. Their
 mission is to secure areas in the forbidden Zones where Toricon plans to
 search for artefacts, test newly developed weapons, and to undermine
 Consortium influence in the above mentioned areas using surprise attacks and
 perhaps by eliminating unwanted witnesses.
#> Signus members are required to pass entrance exams: mental, physical, etc.
 Then they go through weapons training according to their specialisation
 recommended by the entrance exam results, special combat training, and so on.
#> As proposed by president Zening's deputy, every Signus member gets a
 locator code implanted under the skin. With the soldiers' consent of course,
 as the code is considered a badge of membership in the highest elite...
#> Toricon has high expectations for this project, it is the first and so far
 the only one of its kind.
