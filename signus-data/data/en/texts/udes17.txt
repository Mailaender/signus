#> The Ceres fuel transporter is equipped with large fuel tanks from which it
 can refuel friendly vehicles. It has no armament and only minimal armor.
#> This unit has been developed after it proved untenable to send our forces
 back to base after each mission, giving the enemy time to recapture lost
 positions. The rushed development resulted in insufficient armor so it can
 operate only in the rear lines under protection by friendly forces. Keeping
 other units in close proximity to Ceres is also risky because it'll explode
 when destroyed, causing severe damage to its surroundings.
