#> Pagoda is a defense turret armed with medium-range semi-automatic 138mm
 gun. It is heavily armored which allows it to withstand significant damage.
#> The biggest weakness of this turret is its limited range which makes it
 defenseless against long-range weapons and allows highly mobile units to
 escape from its fire.
#> "...and millions of hearts shall soar to You, O Lord! And the celestial
 legion shall ride out of thy gates to protect the white glow hidden in the
 sacred pagoda..." - excerpt from prophet Amhal's modern sutra.
