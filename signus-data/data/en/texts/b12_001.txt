#> Intelligence report about enemy activity in Eutania:
#> Cargo ship Queen en route to the coast of southern Eutania with orders to
 transport a collection of artefacts from Rufion to Tankred was intercepted
 and captured by a warship flying the Consortium flag.
#> We have reasons to believe that the enemy was planning to use the ship,
 which failed to send a distress signal, to continue on the original route and
 steal the artefacts through deceit.
#> Fortunately, both ships were spotted by one of our submarines patrolling
 the area. When the captain realized what is going on, he alerted his
 superiors. Toricon ordered both ships to be destroyed and sent warship
 Artemis anchored near the shore east of Centaur base to transport the
 artefacts instead.
#> The Consortium has launched a ground attack shortly after the ships were
 sunk. They have been secretly gathering forces in Koner Bay for several weeks
 and now they have taken advantage of the situation.
