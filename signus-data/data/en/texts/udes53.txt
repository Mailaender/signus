#> Each airport consists of a radar tower, hangars and a runway. The radar
 tower also serves as the command center. The airport officer reporting
 directly to the captain is stationed there along with air traffic controllers
 who transmit flight instructions to pilots in the air. However, all of these
 air bases are fully automated and they can work without any human operators
 (which often happens when an airport gets captured). Hangars are also fully
 automated and work without human intervention just like radar towers. Each of
 them is equipped with a repair unit which can partially repair damaged
 aircrafts. Runways used by Signus forces are equipped with automatic
 guidance system that controls the aircraft's final approach and landing gear
 deployment, allowing multiple units to land simultaneously.
